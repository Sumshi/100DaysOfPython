	This repo will contain object oriented concepts from freecodecamp
I stopped my 100daysofcode with udemy to focus on 00P this week but will continue it

		PYTHON OBJECTS AND CLASSES:
In conclusion, Python's classes and objects notions are strong ideas that let you write reusable programmes. You may combine information and capabilities into a single entity that is able to be used to build many objects by establishing a class. Using the dot notation, you may access an object's methods and properties after it has been created. You can develop more logical, effective, and manageable code by comprehending Python's classes and objects.


		Python Constructor:
A constructor is a special type of method (function) which is used to initialize the instance members of the class.
Constructors can be of two types.
Parameterized Constructor
Non-parameterized Constructor

In Python, the method the __init__() simulates the constructor of the class. This method is called when the class is instantiated. It accepts the self-keyword as a first argument which allows accessing the attributes or method of the class.
