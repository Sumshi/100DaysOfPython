			DAY 5 TASKS
1) You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

2) You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

3) You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

4) You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
  And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

5) Day 5 Project: Create a Password Generator
