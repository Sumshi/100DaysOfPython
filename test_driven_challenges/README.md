		This file will contain  all my test driven challenges

	challenge 1:
Implement a function called `reverse_string(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.
Your task is to write the implementation code for the `reverse_string()` function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Start by writing test cases to cover different scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.
Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1:
assert reverse_string("Hello") == "olleH"
Test Case 2:
assert reverse_string("") == ""

	challenge 2:
 Implement a function called `count_vowels(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the given string. Consider both lowercase and uppercase vowels.
Your task is to write the implementation code for the `count_vowels()` function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Begin by writing test cases to cover various scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.
Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1:
assert count_vowels("Hello") == 2
Test Case 2:
assert count_vowels("") == 0


	challenge 3:
Implement a function called count_unique_elements(arr) that takes a list of integers arr as input and returns the count of unique elements in the list.
Your task is to write the implementation code for the count_unique_elements() function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Begin by writing test cases to cover various scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.
Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1:
assert count_unique_elements([4, 2, 9, 1, 7]) == 5
Test Case 2:
assert count_unique_elements([8, 3, 5, 0, -2, 8, 3]) == 6
Test Case 3:
assert count_unique_elements([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1
